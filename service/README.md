# Items in Service

Think of this folder as housing the configuration and deployment resources needed to redeploy and run APIM
More "control-plane" related setup than "data-plane"

The goal here is if I were to redeploy an instance of APIM, I would technically only need this folder to setup and deploy APIM itself - however, it would not have any apis/groups/info needed to operate as a gateway for APIs

- /service
    - /certificates
    - /diagnostics
    - PORTAL RELATED INFO AND SCRIPTS
